## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, educational blue (#29ABE2), which invokes intelligence, trust, and professionalism. This contrasts nicely on a light background and is suitable for learning applications.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E1F5FE), maintaining the calm, trustworthy feeling of the blue hue while providing sufficient contrast to the primary color.
- Accent color: An energetic yellow-green (#90EE90), used sparingly for highlighting interactive elements and success indicators. It is analogous to blue, ensuring visual coherence while remaining distinct.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clean and readable UI text. It is neutral, and thus doesn't distract from gameplay.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for code snippets, should this type of reference become required.
- Use simple, clear icons. Make the icons intuitive representations of the represented actions or game types. Use the accent color to denote interactivity.
- Clean, spacious design that uses clear visual hierarchies to guide the user's attention. Maintain a consistent layout across the different game modes.
